# Clock Gating FSM Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to control **clock gating** logic for power-efficient digital systems.

## 🔧 Features
- FSM-based control logic
- Clock gating enable signal generation
- Implemented in Verilog HDL
- Simulated using Xilinx Vivado
- Testbench and waveform verification

## 📂 Files Included
- `clock_gating_FSM.v` – Main FSM design & testbench
- Simulation outputs and reports

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Verilog
- Vivado

## 📊 Output
- Simulated waveforms showing state transitions and `enable_clk` behavior

## ✅ Learning Outcomes
- FSM modeling in Verilog
- Clock gating technique
- Digital design simulation
- Synthesis understanding
